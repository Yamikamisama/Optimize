Let's Talk About that Stack!
============================
* [Meteor.js](https://www.meteor.com/)
    * All about that JavaScript
    * It provides templating that updates automatically when your data models do. This is normally done using Backbone.js, Ember.js, Knockout.js, or another tool.

    * The client/server messaging is done via websockets using something like socks.js or socket.io.

    * The client side connection to mongodb is really cool. It replicates the mongo-server driver into the client. Unfortunately, last I checked, they were still working on securing this database connection.

    * The latency compensation is simply updating the client-side model first, then sending the update to the server-server.
    
* [Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/)
* RESTful and CRUD conventions will be respected.
